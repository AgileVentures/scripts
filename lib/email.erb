Hi <%= name%>,

Hope you're well. Just wanted to reach out and see how you're doing.

Personally I'm working hard to get the AgileVentures charity set up to be sustainable in the long run.

I'd be really interested if you had any thoughts about our new premium plan strategy to support professional development:

I've also made a resolution to blog about the process every day :-) Here's some recent blogs in case you're interested:
